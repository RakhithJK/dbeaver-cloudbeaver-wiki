## Overview 

It is possible to configure CloudBeaver to save database credentials (user names and passwords) in CloudBeaver storage.  
In this case, users won't need to enter database credentials every time they connect to a database.  

However, the most secure way is to disable this option.  See options "Save credentials" and "Save user credentials" in administrator console, page "Server configuration".
