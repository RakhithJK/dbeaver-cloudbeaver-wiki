## Create and configure application in Azure Active Directory
### Register application in Azure Active Directory 
Register a new application according to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application).  
### Configure application credentials
Ð¡loudbeaver uses the OpenId protocol for authorization in Azure Active Directory.  
For this it's necessary configure application secrets - more information on how to do this can be found in the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret).  
Do not forget to record the value of the secret key, it can only be obtained once, otherwise delete the existing secrets and go through this step again.
