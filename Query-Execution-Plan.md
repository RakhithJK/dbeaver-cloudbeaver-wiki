## Execution Plan

If a database driver supports the visualization of the execution plan, you can see the execution plan of the query by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> or clicking the **Explain execution plan** button ![Execution Plan Button](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver/wiki/images/Execution-plan-button.png) on the main toolbar. The execution plan command generates a query execution tree as one of the result tabs and is convenient in estimating if the query/script is quick/optimal enough.<br/>You can click the rows of the execution plan to see their details (statistics) in the panel to the right of the plan.
