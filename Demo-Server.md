We host a demo server where you can see how CloudBeaver looks in real life.

It is a simple server with a few sample databases.

### [Demo Server](https://demo.cloudbeaver.io) - https://demo.cloudbeaver.io

#### Pre-configured databases access:

Database | User | Password
---|---|---
SQLite | n/a | n/a
MySQL | demo | demo
PostgreSQL | demo | demo

#### Custom connections

CloudBeaver doesn't store/cache your credentials or any user data. 
You could try to connect to some of your databases using Custom connection wizard.  

*Warning: it is not secure to open direct access to your database so don't use this on any databases with sensitive data.  
The Demo server is for testing only.*

If you want to use CloudBeaver with your real databases then [[deploy it in your infrastructure|Build-and-deploy]].

#### Security

We didn't pay too much attention on Demo server security.  
It is completely isolated server with no sensitive data.  
But you could try to hack it - please do it gently and please let us know if you will find any security holes.  
Thank you ;-)

**Have fun!**
