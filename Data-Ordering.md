You can order data in columns in one of the following ways:
1. Click the ordering icon ![Ordering Icon](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver/wiki/images/Order-unknown.png) in the header of the column.

   ![Ordering states](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver/wiki/images/Order-states.png) 

   The icon has three states:  
   * Clicking once establishes an ascending order ![Ascending Order](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver/wiki/images/Order-ascending.png)  
   * Clicking a second time changes the order to descending ![Descending Order](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver/wiki/images/Order-descending.png)  
   * Clicking a third time removes the ordering from the column ![Ordering Icon](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver/wiki/images/Order-unknown.png)  

To order data by multiple columns, go column by column, holding the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> (windows) or <kbd>cmd</kbd> (mac) button, setting the order with the Ordering icon, starting from the column by which you want to order the data first.

2. Open the context menu, click **Sorting**. Choose from the ordering states we have mentioned before.
When we choose an ordering state from the context menu, there is no need to hold the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd> button to order data by multiple columns.

To reset the column data ordering to its initial state, open the Cell context menu and click **Sorting -> Disable**. 
If you want to reset all data ordering, open the Cell context menu, then click **Sorting -> Disable all**. You can also click the Ordering icon in the header of the any column to reset all data ordering.
