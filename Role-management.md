You can use roles to manage access permissionsÂ to connections in CloudBeaver. As a role is granted to a user, the role connections become available for the user on the main page. 

Admin and User roles are available by default.

|  Role |   Connections created in Easy Config  |  Connections created in Administration   | Administration menu |

|  User | Available by default. Can be revoked. | Not available by default. Can be granted |          No         |
