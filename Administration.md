## Overview

### Initial Server Configuration
Upon launching the application for the first time, it necessitates an initial setup process. This setup primarily involves configuring specific aspects of the application to ensure optimal functionality.

The initial configuration is a vital step to ensure that the application functions properly and according to your preferences.

The base application settings require certain essential configurations on initial launch. This includes the following components: administrator account, server info and base application behavior
