The Value panel provides additional space in the **Data editor** in which you can manipulate data. The panel is handy if you work with complex types (structures, arrays), long text data or BLOBs.

To open the panel, click the **Value** button on the right hand side of the **Data tab**. Alternatively, you can open the **Value** panel by clicking **Show in value panel** on a cell context menu.

To close the panel, click the **Value** button again.

The **Value** viewer panel displays just one value that is currently selected or in focus and allows editing.

At the top of the **Value** panel, you can find several tabs. The tabs depend on the current value type. For example, if your current value is a string, you will find 4 tabs (Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON), each representing a format the string can be shown in.
