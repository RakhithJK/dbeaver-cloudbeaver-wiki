Once you configure the [[AWS Settings|AWS-Settings]] you can open the Cloud Explorer and start adding AWS database connections. The principle is similar to the usual connections that means you can add connection from the [[Administation part|Administration]] and from the Public part of the app.

In the center of the Cloud Explorer you can see AWS databases in a hierarchical view. All databases are grouped by database/service type. When you expand one of the top elements, CloudBeaver will start to search AWS databases considering the regions you have selected in the [[AWS Settings|AWS-Settings]] section.

If you have a large number of databases in your cloud, you can search or filter them using filter text above the every top element.<br>
You can also check any number of databases in the Cloud Explorer using the checkbox control on the left side of the Cloud Explorer tree.
