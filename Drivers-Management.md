In order to make your new driver functional, you will need to upload `.jar` binary files. Here's how:

1. Locate your newly created driver on the `Driver Management` table. 
2. You can filter for your custom drivers by checking the relevant checkbox in the table filters.
3. Click on your custom driver to open it.
4. Navigate to the `Libraries` tab.
5. Click `Upload Files`, then select your `.jar` files.
6. Confirm that your files have appeared in the table.
7. Click `Save`.

Once the binary files are uploaded, your custom driver is ready to use. It can be selected from the driver list when required.

## Editing an Existing Driver

You can also edit any existing driver. Here are the steps:
