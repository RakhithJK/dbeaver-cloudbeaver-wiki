**Team Edition** is the most comprehensive DBeaver product for effective team collaboration which consists of three parts:

1. A **server** that handles authentication, provisions projects and enables collaboration features

2. Web-based client **CloudBeaver Team Edition**

3. Desktop client **DBeaver Team Edition**.

To start working with Team Edition, go through the following steps:

### Step 1. Server deployment

The server part consists of several docker containers.
We offer instructions for the two most common orchestration technologies: Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
You can find these instructions [in our public git repository](https://github.com/dbeaver/team-edition-deploy/).
If these instructions don't suit your environment or if you need any other help,
please don't hesitate to contact our [technical support](https://dbeaver.com/support/).
