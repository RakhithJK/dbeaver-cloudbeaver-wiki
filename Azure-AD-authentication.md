# Azure Active Directory Configuration
## Create and configure application in Azure Active Directory
### Register application in Azure Active Directory 
Register a new application according to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application).  
### Configure application credentials
Ð¡loudbeaver uses the OpenId protocol for authorization in Azure Active Directory.  
For this it's necessary configure application secrets - more information on how to do this can be found in the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret).  
Do not forget to record the value of the secret key, it can only be obtained once, otherwise delete the existing secrets and go through this step again.

# Optional configuration

Cloudbeaver supports the ability to read and display information about the user's first and last name from the OpeID token, so if you want to support this feature you need to add the **family_name** and **given_name** fields to the response token, more information on how to do this can be found in the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-optional-claims#configuring-optional-claims)
